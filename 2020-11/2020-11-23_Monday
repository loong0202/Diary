Right now -Akon lyrics

It's been so long,
That i haven't seen your face
I'm tryna' be  be strong
but the strength i have is washing way
I won't be long before
I get you by my side
And just hold you
tease you
squeeze you
tell you
what's been on my mind

(x2) start
I wanna make up right
na na na
I wanna make up right
na na na
Wish we never broke up
right na na na
We need to link up
right na na na
(x2) end


Girl,I know mistakes were made between us two
And we show our eyes that now
even says somethings were true
why'd you go and haven't seen my girl since then
why can it be the way it was 'cause you were my homie,lover,and friend'




(x2) start
I wanna make up right
na na na
I wanna make up right
na na na
Wish we never broke up
right na na na
We need to link up
right na na na
(x2) end

(x2) start
I can't lie
I can't miss you much
Watching everyday that goes by
I miss you much
Til i get you back I'm gonna try
Yes,I miss you much
You are the apple of my eye
I miss you much
I miss you much
(x2) end




(x2) start
I wanna make up right
na na na
I wanna make up right
na na na
Wish we never broke up
right na na na
We need to link up
right na na na
(x2) end

(x2) start
I want you to fly with me
Want you to fly
I miss how you lie with me
Miss how you lie
I wish you could dine with me
I wish you could dine with me
One that would grind with me
One that would grind with me
(x2) end



(x2) start
I wanna make up right
na na na
I wanna make up right
na na na
Wish we never broke up
right na na na
We need to link up
right na na na
(x2) end





Questions
1)What's the meaning of"I'm tryna' be  be strong"?

2) what's the meaning of "washing way" in the fourth sentence?
when i search in google or grammarly, i will autowire correct to "wash sth away".
wash away :If water or rain washes something away, it removes it or carries it away.
maybe the lyrics use wrong vocabulary?
