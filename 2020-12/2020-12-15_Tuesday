See you again  Wiz Khalifa
It's been a long day without you,my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when i see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
OH, I'll tell you all about it when i see you again
When i see you again

speaking part start-----
Damn,who knew all the planes we flew good things
we've been though
That I'll be standing right here talking to you about another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up look at things
Different see the bigger picture
Those were the days hard work forever pays
Now i see you in a better place
UH,how can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything i went through,you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
speaking part end-----

It's been a long day without you,my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when i see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
OH, I'll tell you all about it when i see you again
When i see you again


speaking part start-----
First,you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship,
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first,
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached,
So remember me when i'm gone
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got
Everything i went through, You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
speaking part end-----


So let the light guide your way,YEAH
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home,home
It's been a long day without you,my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when i see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
OH, I'll tell you all about it when i see you again
When i see you again
